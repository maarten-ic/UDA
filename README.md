# Universal Data Access (UDA)

![Build Workflow](https://github.com/ukaea/UDA/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)

The UDA API provides plugin driven data abstraction.

The UDA can be either run as a client-server API, running as thin client with all functionality being handled on a
remote server, or as fat-client API where both the client access and plugin functionality is run on the local machine.

Note this is a compatibility branch which only uses c++11 features and will only receive essential bug fixes. Current and future development on the main branch will require a c++17 compiler. 

## Licence

See LICENCE.txt for details.

#### CentOS

Packages needed for CentOS

    $ LANG=C sudo yum -y groupinstall 'Development Tools'
    $ sudo yum -y install openssl-devel boost-devel swig-devel python-devel \
      postgresql-devel libxml2-devel gsl-devel libgcrypt-devel bzip2-devel \
      java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

#### Ubuntu

    sudo apt-get install git python3-dev libssl-dev libboost-dev python3-numpy python3-matplotlib

#### OSX

### Running cmake configuration

To configure the UDA build you first need to run cmake:

    cmake -B<build_dir> -H. -DTARGET_TYPE:STRING=<target>

Where `<build_dir>` is the build directory to create and `<target>` is the target specific configuration to use. The
different targets available are `MAST`, `ITER` and `OTHER`. These are available in the `cmake/Config` directory with
the file name `target-<target>.cmake`. To add a new target simply copy one of these files and rename to the desired target name.

An example configuration command is:

    cmake -Bbuild -H. -DTARGET_TYPE:STRING=OTHER

By default UDA will configure to build in client-server mode with both the client and server being built.

To only build the client use:

    cmake -DCLIENT_ONLY:BOOL=TRUE ...

To build UDA in fat-client mode use:

    cmake -DFAT_BUILD:BOOL=TRUE ...

### Building

    make -C <build_dir>

### Installing

    make -C <build_dir> install

### Packaging

On Linux system:

    make -C <build_dir> package

On Windows system (MinGW):

    make -C <build_dir> package

On Windows system (VS2019):

    msbuild.exe INSTALL.vcxproj /p:configuration=release /p:platform=x64

## Visual Studio

UDA can be compiled with Visaul Studio 2019.
To do that, Vidual Studio need to be iunstalled witrh at least the following packages:

- C++ Desktop development tools
- CMake tools
- Python 3.7
- MFC and ATL libraries
- English language pack (even if you choose another language)
- Windows 10 SDK v10.0.17134.0

## vcpkg

vcpkg if a library manager designed by Microsoft to procure standard libraries for Visual Studio.

It supports CMake toolchain, easily usable with UDA CMakeList.txt files.

To use vcpkg, follow theses steps:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg
    cd vcpkg
    bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

After that, vcpkg tool is ready to acquire libraries.
For UDA, severals libraries are mandatory, the following command download, compile and install them :

    vcpkg install libxml2:x64-windows openssl:x64-windows boost:x64-windows python3:x64-windows dlfcn-win32:x64-windows libpq:x64-windows netcdf-c:x64-windows blitz:x64-windows

## Other Notes

Ninja installation for CentOS:

    git clone https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja.git

    cd ninja
    ./configure.py --bootstrap
    export PATH="${HOME}/ninja:${PATH}"

Add the following to your .bashrc file:

    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/include
