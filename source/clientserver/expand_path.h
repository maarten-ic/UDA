/*! Substitute/Replace file path name elements for server side name resolution.

Client and server may see different network file paths. A path seen by the client is different to the path seen by the
server. Generally, the path might contain additional hierarchical components that need removing. This is
easily done by substitution.

Examples:    /.automount/funsrv1/root/home/xyz -> /net/funsrv1/home/xyz
        /.automount/funsrv1/root/home/xyz -> /home/xyz
        /.automount/fuslsd/root/data/MAST_Data/013/13500/Pass0/amc0135.00 -> /net/fuslsd/data/MAST_Data/013/13500/Pass0/amc0135.00
        /scratch/mydata -> /net/hostname/scratch/mydata

A list of Target path components is read from the environment variable IDAM_PRIVATE_PATH_TARGET. The delimiter between
components is , or : or ;.
A matching list of substitutes path components is read from the environment variable IDAM_PRIVATE_PATH_SUBSTITUTE.

A maximum number of 10 substitutes is allowed.

Use multiple wild card * for any target path element name
Target and replacement must begin /

If a * appears in both the target and substitute paths, the path element is retained in the replacement.
The number of wildcards must match

If there are more wildcards in the substitute string than in the target string, an error will occur.

@param path The path to be tested for targeted name element replacement.
@returns An integer Error Code: If non zero, a problem occured.
